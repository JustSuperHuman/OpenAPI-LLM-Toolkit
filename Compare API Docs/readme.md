# OpenAPI Spec Comparison Script

Welcome! This script is designed to make comparing two versions of OpenAPI specifications (such as those generated by .NET Swagger and your OpenAPI documentation) straightforward. By doing this, you can identify changes, catch any inconsistencies, and ensure that your API documentation is up-to-date with your actual API behavior.

## What Does This Script Do?

This script:
1. **Downloads or Locates Your Specs**: If you provide URLs for your specs, the script will download them for you. If they’re local files, it’ll just grab them directly.
2. **Preprocesses**: It resolves circular references within your JSON schema, replacing complex nested structures with clearer examples to make your spec easier to understand.
3. **Bundles**: Using the `redocly bundle` command, it combines your spec into a fully dereferenced version, which ensures all references are fully resolved for accurate comparison.
4. **Compares**: Finally, it uses `openapi-diff` to compare the two bundled specs, highlighting any changes between them. This gives you insights into what’s new, modified, or removed.

## Why Use This?

APIs evolve, and it can be challenging to ensure documentation reflects the latest updates. With this tool:
- You can compare an OpenAPI spec generated by .NET’s Swagger with a spec you’ve maintained separately to see where they align or differ.
- It’s a great way to catch unnoticed changes in your API that might impact consumers.
- Streamlined for a quick comparison, it saves time on manual inspection.

## How to Use

1. **Prepare Your Specs**: Identify two specs to compare. They can be URLs (to pull from a hosted location) or local file paths.
2. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   node script.js <old-spec> <new-spec>
